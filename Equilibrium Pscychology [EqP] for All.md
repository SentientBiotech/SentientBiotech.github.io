    <p>Equilibrium Psychology, developed from the foundational concept of Equilibrium Thinking, represents a novel approach in the field of psychology.</p>

    <p>The transformative power of Equilibrium Thinking in overcoming personal adversities and promoting mental wellness has paved the way for a comprehensive psychological framework that balances both negative and positive aspects of human experience.</p>

    <p>EQ Thinking works on the binary aspect of 0’s and 1’s, just like the modern machines. EQ Thinking is a dual-process approach encapsulated in the phrases “be at it” and “beat it.” These concepts form the bedrock of Equilibrium Psychology, a field that integrates elements of both positive and negative psychology to foster mental resilience and growth.</p>
