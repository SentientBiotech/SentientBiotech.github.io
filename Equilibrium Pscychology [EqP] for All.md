Equilibrium Psychology, developed from the foundational concept of Equilibrium Thinking, represents a novel approach in the field of psychology. 


The transformative power of Equilibrium Thinking in overcoming personal adversities and promoting mental wellness has paved the way for a comprehensive psychological framework that balances both negative and positive aspects of human experience.


EQ Thinking works on the binary aspect of 0’s and 1’s, just like the modern machines. EQ Thinking is a dual-process approach encapsulated in the phrases “be at it” and “beat it.” These concepts form the bedrock of Equilibrium Psychology, a field that integrates elements of both positive and negative psychology to foster mental resilience and growth.
