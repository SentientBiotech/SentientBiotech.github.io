    <p>A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a revolutionary technology that allows direct communication between the brain and external devices. BCIs capture brain signals and translate them into commands that can control digital systems or provide real-time feedback on brain activity.</p>
    
    <p>At Sentient Biotech, we leverage this cutting-edge technology to monitor brainwave patterns via our EEG headset, enabling users to receive personalized neurofeedback.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike traditional approaches to mental health, BCI systems offer non-invasive, real-time insights into cognitive states like focus, relaxation, and stress.</p>
    
    <p>BCIs are transforming the fields of healthcare, wellness, and neurotherapy by empowering individuals to take control of their brain activity in ways that were previously unimaginable.</p>
