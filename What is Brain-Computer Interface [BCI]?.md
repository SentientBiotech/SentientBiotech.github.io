A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a revolutionary technology that allows direct communication between the brain and external devices. 
BCIs capture brain signals and translate them into commands that can control digital systems or provide real-time feedback on brain activity. 

At Sentient Biotech, we leverage this cutting-edge technology to monitor brainwave patterns via our EEG headset, enabling users to receive personalized neurofeedback.

Unlike traditional approaches to mental health, BCI systems offer non-invasive, real-time insights into cognitive states like focus, relaxation, and stress. 

BCIs are transforming the fields of healthcare, wellness, and neurotherapy by empowering individuals to take control of their brain activity in ways that were previously unimaginable.
